# Hello there! 🚀

- 🧙 I am but a humble Javascript programmer who dabbles in the art of front-end development.
- ✨ I often wax philosophically about the wonders of Next.js and TailwindCSS.
- 🖥️ My remaining time is spent discovering tools that improve the developer experience.
- 🏡 Thank you for stumbling across my most humble abode and further more for getting this far.
- 🌍 Feel free to vist [my website](https://sizwe.vercel.app/) where you'll find relatively little going on.

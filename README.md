# Hello there! ðŸš€

I am but a humble Javascript programmer who dabbles in the art of web development.
Next.js and TailwindCSS are my current weapons of choice and I've recently dived into the world of Typescript.
The remainder of my time is spent discovering tools that improve developer experience.
I thank you yet again for stumbling across my most humble abode and further more for getting this far.
I felt rather inspired to wax philosophic

Feel free to vist [my website](https://sizwe.vercel.app/) where you'll find relatively little going on.
